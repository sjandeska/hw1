  <h1> What are kidneys? </h1>

  <h2>The kidneys are organs responsible for:
<body>
  <ul><li> maintaining normal concentrations of electrolytes in the bloodstream</li>
  <li> filtering blood and ridding toxic and excess electrolytes in the form of urine </li>
</body>
  <p><h3> Most people are born with two kidneys...</p>
  <p> But we know that one can live a long life with only one good kidney.
  <ul><li>As you can see, they are located near the back, and mostly covered by your ribcage, muscle, and fat.</li>
  <li>Traumatic injury to the kidney commonly occurs after a blow to the back (i.e. kick or punch).</li></h3>

  <h4>How do kidneys work? </h4>
  <p> Each kidney consists of millions of nephrons which work side-by-side.</p>
  <p>Each <span class="highlighter">nephron</span> acts as part of an assembly line, each part with its own purpose.</p>
  <p>The initial part is called the <span class="highlighter">glomerulus</span>, and it filters the blood, like a collander filters pasta in boiling water.</p>
  <p>The fluid that passes through the collander is like the urine that the kidney ultimately sends to the bladder.</p>
  <p>The pasta that stays behind is like the cells and protein that the healthy kidney recirculates back into the bloodstream.   </p>

  <h5> How do we know that kidneys work?</h5>
  <p>  Most people with kidney disease feel fine, and have no symptoms.</p>
  <p>  Unfortunately, our physical exam is an insensitive way to know if someone has kidney disease.</p>
  <p>  Fortunately, we have tests and imaging studies that can answer this question with 100% certainty.</p>
