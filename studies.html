  <h1>How do we know that kidneys are functioning well?</h1>
</body>
<body>
  <h2>Blood testing</h2>
  <h3>Serum creatinine</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Creatinine is a <strong>surrogate marker</strong> that we use to determine if the kidneys are filtering blood well.</li>
      <li>Creatinine itself does not harm the body; it is a natural product of muscle breakdown.</li>
      <li>It is rid by the kidney in the form of urine, and is mostly filtered by the glomerulus.</li>
</body>
  <h4>Urine testing</h4>
  <h5>Protein</h5>
  <ul>
      <li>A normal glomerulus will filter blood without allowing an excess of protein leak into the tubules.</li>
      <li>Albumin is the specific protein kidney doctors look for in the urine.</li>
      <li>Your pediatrician might refer your child if they detect albumin in a urine sample from a urine dipstick.</li>
