  <h1> What are kidneys?</h1>
  <p><img src="kidneys and anatomy.jpg"></p>
  <p> As you can see, their location is much closer to the back than to your abdomen. </p>
  <h2>What do kidneys do anyways? </h2>
  <p> The kidney is an organ that is responsible for cleaning the blood and maintaining normal amounts of electrolytes in the bloodstream.
    They clean blood by filtering it, like a collander is used to filter pasta after it is cooked in boiling water.  Once the pasta and water is spilled
    into the collander, the collander keeps the pasta (electrolytes, cells, protein-- the good stuff) and allows the pasta water to flow into the sink and down the drain.
    The pasta water is like the urine that the kidney sends to the urinary tract.  However the pipes connecting your sink to the sewer line is not as specialized as
    the "pipes" that are also part of the kidney.  These pipes selectively remove electrolytes that are needed to keep your cells alive.  Some examples of electrolytes are
    sodium, potassium, and calcium.   </p>
